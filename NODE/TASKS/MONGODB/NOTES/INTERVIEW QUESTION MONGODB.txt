1. What is MongoDB? What is MongoDB Cluster?
MongoDB

MongoDB is a NoSQL database used to store data in JSON-like format called documents.

It stores data in collections

Each collection contains documents

Documents are stored in BSON format (Binary JSON)

Example Document:
{
  "name": "Abishek",
  "age": 22,
  "role": "Developer"
}

Why MongoDB is used?

Flexible schema

Fast performance

Easy to use with Node.js

Used in modern applications

MongoDB Cluster

A MongoDB Cluster is a group of MongoDB databases hosted in the cloud.

Example: MongoDB Atlas Cluster

Cluster contains:

Database

Collections

Documents

Cluster is used for:

Cloud storage

High availability

Backup

Security

2. What are ORM methods?
ORM = Object Relational Mapping

ORM is used to connect SQL databases with programming languages.

It converts:

Database Table → Object
Object → Database Table

Example:

SQL table → User
Code → User object

Example ORM tools:

Sequelize

TypeORM

Prisma

3. What is ODM? Why we use?
ODM = Object Document Mapping

ODM is used to connect MongoDB (NoSQL) with programming languages.

It converts:

MongoDB Document → JavaScript Object
JavaScript Object → MongoDB Document

Why we use ODM?

Easy database operations

Validation support

Cleaner code

Structure for data

Example ODM:

Mongoose

4. What is Mongoose? Why we use?

Mongoose is an ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js

It helps to:

Connect MongoDB with Node.js

Create schema

Create models

Perform CRUD operations

Why use Mongoose?

Schema validation

Easy CRUD operations

Cleaner code

Middleware support

Example:

const mongoose = require("mongoose");

mongoose.connect("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/mydb");

console.log("Database connected");

5. What is DB?

DB = Database

Database is a place where data is stored and managed.

Example:

Student data

User data

Product data

Example:

Database: School
Collection: Students
Document:
{
 name: "Abishek",
 age: 22
}

6. How to connect DB in Node.js and show connected message in CMD?

Step 1: Install mongoose

npm install mongoose


Step 2: Connect database

const mongoose = require("mongoose");

mongoose.connect("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/mydb")
.then(() => {
    console.log("Database Connected Successfully");
})
.catch((error) => {
    console.log("Database Connection Failed", error);
});


Step 3: Run file

node app.js


Output in CMD:

Database Connected Successfully

7. Difference between SQL and NoSQL
SQL	NoSQL
Structured	Unstructured
Uses tables	Uses collections
Uses rows	Uses documents
Fixed schema	Flexible schema
Example: MySQL	Example: MongoDB
Uses SQL query	Uses JSON format

Example SQL:

Table: Users
Columns: id, name, age


Example NoSQL:

{
 name: "Abishek",
 age: 22
}

8. What is Collections?

Collection is a group of documents

Collection is like a table in SQL

Example:
Collection name: users

Inside users collection:

{
 name: "Abishek"
}
{
 name: "John"
}

9. What is Document in MongoDB?

Document is a single record in MongoDB

Document is stored in JSON format

Example:

{
 name: "Abishek",
 age: 22,
 role: "Developer"
}


Collection → users
Document → one user data

10. What is Compass? Why we use?
MongoDB Compass

MongoDB Compass is a GUI tool for MongoDB

It helps to:

View database

Create database

Insert data

Delete data

Edit data

No coding required

Why use Compass?

Easy to manage database

Visual interface

Beginner friendly

Example:
You can see:

Database

Collection

Documents

Simple Real Life Example Summary
