React Router DOM (RRD)

React Router DOM is a library used to handle navigation and routing in React single-page applications (SPA) without page reload.

👉 It maps URL paths → React components.

🧭 BrowserRouter

BrowserRouter is the main router wrapper.

Uses HTML5 history API

Keeps UI in sync with browser URL

Must wrap your entire app (or routing part)

📝 Rule: You can use only one BrowserRouter in an app.

<BrowserRouter>
  <App />
</BrowserRouter>

🗂️ Routes & Route
Routes

Container for all routes

Replaces older Switch

Route

Defines path + component

<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
  <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
</Routes>


🧠 How it works:

When URL matches path, its component renders

Only one matching route renders at a time

🚫 Navigation using <a href="">

Using normal HTML anchor tags:

<a href="/about">About</a>

❌ Problems

Page reloads completely

React state is lost

SPA behavior breaks

📌 Avoid <a> for internal navigation

✅ Link

Link replaces <a> in React apps.

Prevents page reload

Fast navigation

Maintains SPA behavior

<Link to="/about">About</Link>


🟢 Use Link for internal routes
🔵 Use <a> only for external links

⭐ NavLink (Active Tab)

NavLink is like Link but knows when it is active.

Benefits

Adds active class automatically

Useful for navbar menus

<NavLink to="/home">Home</NavLink>

Active Styling
<NavLink
  to="/home"
  className={({ isActive }) => isActive ? "active" : ""}
>
  Home
</NavLink>


🧠 Common interview point:

Difference between Link and NavLink
✔ NavLink supports active styling

🧩 Outlet (Child Component Rendering)

Outlet is used for nested routes.

Why?

To show child components inside parent layout

<Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />}>
  <Route path="profile" element={<Profile />} />
</Route>


In Dashboard.jsx:

<Outlet />


📌 URL:

/dashboard → Dashboard

/dashboard/profile → Dashboard + Profile inside Outlet

🧭 useNavigate() Hook

useNavigate() is used for programmatic navigation.

When to use

After login

After form submit

Button click navigation

const navigate = useNavigate();

navigate("/home");

Go Back / Forward
navigate(-1); // back
navigate(1);  // forward


🧠 Alternative to:

history.push()

🎨 React Icons

React Icons is a library that provides icons as React components.

Benefits

Easy to use

Lightweight

Supports many icon packs

import { FaHome } from "react-icons/fa";

<FaHome />

Common Packs

fa → Font Awesome

md → Material Design

ai → Ant Design

bs → Bootstrap

📌 Icons behave like normal React components
✔ Can style using CSS or inline styles
