Part 1: Class Components & Advanced Concepts
1️⃣ What is a class component in React, and how is it different from a functional component?

Class Component

Uses ES6 class

Extends React.Component

Has lifecycle methods

Uses this.state and this.setState()

Functional Component

Uses JavaScript functions

Uses Hooks (useState, useEffect)

Simpler and preferred in modern React

Key Differences

Feature	Class Component	Functional Component
Syntax	Class-based	Function-based
State	this.state	useState
Lifecycle	Lifecycle methods	Hooks
this keyword	Required	Not needed
Performance	Slightly heavier	Lighter & faster
Usage today	Less preferred	Recommended

👉 Modern React uses functional components with hooks

2️⃣ Explain React class lifecycle methods and their use cases

Lifecycle methods are called at different phases of a component.

🔹 Mounting (Component creation)
Method	Use Case
constructor()	Initialize state
render()	Render UI
componentDidMount()	API calls, subscriptions
🔹 Updating (State/props change)
Method	Use Case
shouldComponentUpdate()	Performance optimization
render()	Re-render UI
componentDidUpdate()	React to prop/state changes
🔹 Unmounting (Component removal)
Method	Use Case
componentWillUnmount()	Cleanup (timers, listeners)
🔹 Error Handling
Method	Use Case
componentDidCatch()	Catch UI errors
3️⃣ How does setState work, and why is it asynchronous?

setState() does not update immediately

React batches multiple updates for better performance

UI updates happen after reconciliation

Why async?

Prevents unnecessary re-renders

Improves performance

Ensures consistency

Correct way when depending on previous state

this.setState(prevState => ({
  count: prevState.count + 1
}));

4️⃣ What is PureComponent and how is it different?

PureComponent

Automatically implements shouldComponentUpdate()

Uses shallow comparison of props & state

Feature	Component	PureComponent
Re-render	Always	Only if data changes
Optimization	Manual	Automatic
Comparison	No	Shallow

Use Case

Performance optimization

When props/state are immutable

⚠️ Avoid with deep objects (can cause bugs)

5️⃣ How do you implement Error Boundaries, and why class components?

Error Boundaries

Catch JavaScript errors in UI

Prevent app crash

Show fallback UI

Implemented using

componentDidCatch()

getDerivedStateFromError()

❗ Why only class components?

Hooks cannot catch render-time errors

React currently supports error boundaries only via classes

Use Cases

Wrapping pages

Handling unexpected UI crashes

Improving UX stability

🔹 Part 2: Basic React Interview Questions (5)
6️⃣ What is React, and what problem does it solve?

React

JavaScript library for building UIs

Created by Facebook

Component-based architecture

Problems it solves

Slow DOM manipulation

Complex UI updates

Code reusability issues

React Solution

Virtual DOM

Component-based design

One-way data flow

7️⃣ What is JSX and how is it different from HTML?

JSX

JavaScript XML

Allows writing HTML-like syntax in JS

Differences

JSX	HTML
Compiled by Babel	Used directly
className	class
Expressions allowed {}	Not allowed
CamelCase attributes	Normal
8️⃣ Difference between props and state
Feature	Props	State
Ownership	Parent	Component
Mutability	Read-only	Mutable
Purpose	Pass data	Manage data

Example

Props → username

State → login status

9️⃣ What is the Virtual DOM?

Lightweight copy of the real DOM

Stored in memory

React compares changes using diffing algorithm

Process

Change happens

Virtual DOM updated

React finds minimal changes

Real DOM updated efficiently

👉 Result: Faster UI updates

🔟 What is a component in React? Types?

Component

Reusable UI block

Accepts input (props)

Returns UI

Main Types

Functional Components (most used)

Class Components

Higher Order Components

Controlled & Uncontrolled Components

✅ Interview Tip

If asked:

“Which component type should we use today?”

✔️ Answer: Functional components with Hooks, unless error boundaries are needed.
