1️⃣ How do you fetch products from an API using useEffect with async/await?

You use useEffect to run the API call after the component mounts.

Since useEffect itself cannot be async, you define an async function inside it and call it.

useEffect(() => {
  const fetchProducts = async () => {
    const res = await fetch("https://api.com/products");
    const data = await res.json();
    setProducts(data);
  };


  fetchProducts();
}, []);
2️⃣ What is a controlled <select> in React?

A controlled <select> is one where:

The selected value comes from React state

Changes are handled using onChange

<select value={category} onChange={(e) => setCategory(e.target.value)}>
  <option value="all">All</option>
</select>

➡️ React fully controls the dropdown value.

3️⃣ Why do we keep the selected category in state?

To remember the user’s selection

To re-filter products when the category changes

To trigger automatic re-rendering

Without state, React wouldn’t know the selection changed.

4️⃣ Why is a default value like "all" used in the dropdown?

To show all products initially

To avoid empty UI on first load

To give users a clear “no filter” option

const [category, setCategory] = useState("all");
5️⃣ How do you filter products based on the selected category?

Use .filter() on the products array

If category is "all", return everything

const filteredProducts =
  category === "all"
    ? products
    : products.filter(p => p.category === category);
6️⃣ What is derived data, and where do you compute it?

Derived data is data calculated from existing state

Example: filtered products from products + category

📌 It should be computed:

Inside the component

During render (not stored in state)

const filteredProducts = ...
7️⃣ Why shouldn’t you modify the original products array while filtering?

React relies on immutability

Modifying original data:

Breaks re-renders

Causes bugs

Loses original data

❌ Wrong:

products.splice(...)

✅ Correct:

products.filter(...)
8️⃣ How does React know to re-render when the category changes?

setCategory() updates state

State change → React triggers re-render

Component re-runs → filtered data updates automatically

➡️ This is React’s reactivity system.

9️⃣ How do you render <option> elements dynamically from API data?

Fetch categories from API

Use .map() to render options

{categories.map(cat => (
  <option key={cat} value={cat}>
    {cat}
  </option>
))}
🔟 How do you handle “No products found” after filtering?

Check filtered array length

Show a message conditionally

{filteredProducts.length === 0 ? (
  <p>No products found</p>
) : (
  filteredProducts.map(p => <Product key={p.id} {...p} />)
)}
