React
1. What are all the hooks you know?

React Hooks are special functions that let us use state and other React features in functional components.

Commonly used hooks:

useState – to manage state

useEffect – to handle side effects (API calls, lifecycle)

useContext – to use context data

useRef – to access DOM elements or persist values

useMemo – to optimize performance by memoizing values

useCallback – to memoize functions

useReducer – to manage complex state logic

useLayoutEffect – runs before browser paint

useImperativeHandle – customizes ref behavior

2. Use of Frontend

The frontend is the user interface of a web application.

Uses:

Displays content to users

Handles user interactions (clicks, forms, inputs)

Sends requests to backend APIs

Shows data received from backend

Improves user experience (UI/UX)

Examples: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

3. Difference between React and JavaScript
React	JavaScript
React is a library	JavaScript is a programming language
Used for building UI	Used for logic and functionality
Component-based	Not component-based
Uses Virtual DOM	Uses Real DOM
Faster UI updates	Slower DOM manipulation
4. What is CSR?

CSR (Client-Side Rendering) means the browser loads a minimal HTML file and JavaScript renders the content on the client side.

Features:

Rendering happens in the browser

Faster page transitions

Used by React, Vue, Angular

Initial load may be slower

5. How do you pass data to the backend?

Data is passed to the backend using:

HTTP methods like:

GET

POST

PUT

DELETE

Fetch API or Axios

Data formats:

JSON

Form Data

Example: Sending form data using POST request

Node.js
1. What is Node?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser.

Uses:

Build backend servers

Handle APIs

Work with databases

Create real-time applications

2. What are all the imported modules in Node?

Node has built-in modules and external modules.

Built-in modules:

http

fs (File System)

path

os

url

events

External modules:

express

mongoose

dotenv

cors

nodemon

3. Difference between Node and JavaScript
Node.js	JavaScript
Runtime environment	Programming language
Runs on server	Runs in browser
Can access file system	Cannot access file system
Used for backend	Used for frontend
4. What is a server?

A server is a system that:

Receives requests from clients

Processes the request

Sends responses back

Example:

Client → Request → Server → Response

5. What is backend process in Node?

Backend process in Node includes:

Receiving client requests

Handling routes

Processing business logic

Connecting to databases

Sending response to frontend

Managing authentication and security
