1️⃣ What is React? Why is it called a library and not a framework?

React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces, especially single-page applications.

Why library, not framework?

React focuses only on the UI layer

It doesn’t force rules for:

Routing

State management

Data fetching

You choose your own tools (React Router, Redux, Axios, etc.)

➡️ Frameworks (like Angular) give a full structure
➡️ React gives flexibility → that’s why it’s a library

2️⃣ What is Virtual DOM? How is it different from Real DOM?

Virtual DOM

A lightweight JavaScript copy of the Real DOM

React updates this first

Compares changes using diffing algorithm

Updates only the changed parts in Real DOM

Real DOM

Actual browser DOM

Direct manipulation is slow

Re-renders entire UI on changes

Difference
Virtual DOM	Real DOM
Fast updates	Slower
JS object	Browser structure
Updates selectively	Re-renders more
Better performance	Performance heavy
3️⃣ What are components in React?
Difference between Functional and Class Components?

Components

Reusable UI blocks

Each component manages its own logic & UI

Functional Components

JavaScript functions

Use Hooks

Simpler & preferred

function Hello() {
  return <h1>Hello</h1>;
}

Class Components

ES6 classes

Use lifecycle methods

More complex

class Hello extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello</h1>;
  }
}

Key Differences
Functional	Class
Uses Hooks	Uses lifecycle methods
Less code	More boilerplate
Easier to read	Harder
Recommended	Legacy
4️⃣ What are Hooks? Why were Hooks introduced?

Hooks

Special functions that let you use state & lifecycle features in functional components

Examples:

useState

useEffect

useRef

Why introduced?

Avoid complex class components

Reuse logic easily

Cleaner & readable code

➡️ Hooks made functional components powerful

5️⃣ Difference between useState and useReducer?
When to use which?
useState

Simple state

Few values

Easy updates

const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

useReducer

Complex state logic

Multiple actions

Similar to Redux

const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

Comparison
useState	useReducer
Simple logic	Complex logic
Direct update	Action-based
Small apps	Large apps
Easy	More structured

➡️ Use useReducer when state depends on previous state & multiple actions

6️⃣ What is Prop Drilling? How can it be avoided?

Prop Drilling

Passing props through multiple components unnecessarily

Example:

App → A → B → C


Problems

Hard to manage

Less readable

How to Avoid

Context API

Redux / Zustand

Component composition

➡️ Best solution: Context API for medium apps

7️⃣ What is Lazy Loading in React? Why is it important?

Lazy Loading

Load components only when needed

Uses React.lazy() & Suspense

const About = React.lazy(() => import('./About'));


Why important?

Reduces initial bundle size

Faster page load

Better performance

➡️ Essential for large apps

8️⃣ Purpose of useEffect & Dependency Array behavior

useEffect

Handles side effects

API calls

DOM updates

Subscriptions

Timers

useEffect(() => {
  // side effect
}, []);

Dependency Array Behavior
Dependency	When it runs
No array	Every render
[]	Once (on mount)
[value]	When value changes

➡️ Controls when effect runs

9️⃣ Difference between useRef and useState
useState

Triggers re-render on update

Used for UI data

useRef

Does not trigger re-render

Stores mutable values

Access DOM elements

const inputRef = useRef();

Comparison
useState	useRef
Causes re-render	No re-render
UI data	DOM / mutable values
Async updates	Sync
🔟 Role of Keys in React Lists

Keys

Unique identifier for list items

Helps React track changes efficiently

items.map(item => (
  <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
))


Why important?

Improves performance

Prevents wrong UI updates

Helps React’s diffing algorithm

➡️ Never use index as key (unless list is static)
