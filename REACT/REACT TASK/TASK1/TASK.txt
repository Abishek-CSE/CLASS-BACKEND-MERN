1) Components (class + function) + CSS + Image
Create a single page that shows a profile section:

One function component: ProfileCardFn.

Use a local image from src/assets as avatarUrl.

Add basic CSS (border, padding, hover scale on card) in ProfileCard.css.


3) Rendering primitives, arrays, objects
Create RenderingPlayground component:

Render:

A primitive: name (string), age (number).

An object: user = { name, city } → show both fields.

An array of strings: ["HTML","CSS","JS","React"] using map.

An array of objects: products = [{id,name,price},...] as a simple table.

Import and render RenderingPlayground inside App.​


4) Conditional / optional / nullish
Create UserStatus component with prop user:

If user is null, show: “Loading user…”.

Else show:

user?.name ?? "Guest User"

user?.email ?? "No email provided"

Also show “Active User” only if user?.isActive is true (ternary or &&).​

In App, keep one state and toggle between null and a user object with a button.


5) React Router DOM basic SPA
In the same project, install router: npm install react-router-dom.​

Wrap <App /> with <BrowserRouter> in main.jsx.​

In App, create three routes using Routes and Route:

/ → Home

/about → About

/contact → Contact

Add a nav bar with <Link> to all three routes at the top.
